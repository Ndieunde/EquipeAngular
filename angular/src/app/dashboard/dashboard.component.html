<!--
The *ngFor repeater creates as many links as are in the component's heroes array.
The links are styled as colored blocks by the dashboard.component.css.
The links don't go anywhere yet but they will shortly.  

The class is similar to the HeroesComponent class.

It defines a heroes array property
The constructor expects Angular to inject the HeroService into a private heroService property
The ngOnInit() lifecycle hook calls getHeroes()
-->

<h2>Top Heroes</h2>

  <a *ngFor="let hero of heroes"
  routerLink="/detail/{{hero.id}}">
    {{hero.name}}
